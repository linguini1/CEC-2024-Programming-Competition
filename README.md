# Rundle Retrievers

## The Challenge

To create a program that would find the optimal resource extraction path for up to two drill rigs on a remote island,
while ensuring that local flora and fauna are preserved.

The challenge requires both an optimal algorithm and a visualization that is easy to use for non-programmers.

## Requirements

**Language:** Python 3.11

All Python application requirements are listed in the [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) file.

## Quickstart

To start the UI and computation, follow these steps:

- Open your terminal within the project's root directory.
- Install the project dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Run the main application using `py app.py` on Windows, or `python3 app.py` on Linux.
- After a few seconds, you should see an output similar to the following:

```console
* Serving Flask app 'app'
* Debug mode: off
WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead.
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
Press CTRL+C to quit
```

- CTRL + click on the displayed URL (`http://127.0.0.1:8000`) or paste it into your browser search bar to open the UI.
- You can now click the "Next Day" button on the UI to compute the next step of the simulation.
